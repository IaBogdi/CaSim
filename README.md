# CaSim

This software computes the reaction-diffusion and constructed so that it is possible to natively add new models of specific compartments (jSR, dyadic space, cytosol) and ion channel gating models. The folder "examples" contains some of the configuration .json files with RyR coordiantes presented in my upcoming PhD thesis.
